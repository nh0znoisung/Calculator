    - Can be compared to a project's architect, with a software developer being the carpenter. The engineers outline the specifics by designing, coordinating and overseeing the project. Developers then execute these plans and write the code that brings the project to fruition.

    - Connect a client's needs to technological solutions by using systematic processes and engineering concepts to create software. Software developers, on the other hand, collaborate with the client to decide on a functional design. In other words, developers often act as the creative driving force behind software design and development
    
* Software Developer (Programmer)
    - Focus on creating functional programs through the use of art and creativity, while software engineers utilize scientific methods and engineering principles to create reliable solutions

    - Tend to approach problems creatively. Instead of relying on education and protocols like engineers, developers utilize practices and patterns that they likely learned through self-discovery and external sources, such as blogs and books.
